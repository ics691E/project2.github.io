## Overview

Players will need to choose wisely which skills to pursue based on their gameplay style or the challenges they anticipate facing with the final boss.

Starting Equipment: Each player begins with a basic bow and a set of arrows.

Fields: Each of the six fields tests different skills:

- Catch the Capsule: Requires precision and timing to catch moving targets.
- Maze Runner: Focuses on navigation and quick decision-making.

Skill Acquisition: Players choose only two fields to enter and gain skills or items that will significantly influence their abilities in the final battle.

Final Boss: After acquiring skills, players face a challenging boss that requires a combination of the skills learned.
